# retail-EDA
To conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided sample Superstore dataset, we will follow these detailed steps:

# Data Overview and Initial Inspection
# Data Cleaning
# Descriptive Statistics
# Data Visualization
# Identifying Business Problems and Weak Areas

Let's start with each step.

## 1. Data Overview and Initial Inspection
We will begin by loading the data and inspecting its structure, which includes checking for missing values, understanding the types of data in each column, and getting a general sense of the dataset.

## 2. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involves handling missing values, correcting data types, and addressing any inconsistencies in the data.

## 3. Descriptive Statistics
This step includes calculating various statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., to summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution.

## 4. Data Visualization
We will create visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships in the data. This will include:

- Sales and Profit analysis by different categories such as Segment, Region, and Sub-Category.
- Analysis of Discounts and their impact on Profit.
- Visualization of high-profit and low-profit areas.

## 5. Identifying Business Problems and Weak Areas
Based on the EDA, we will identify key business problems and areas where improvements can be made to increase profitability.
